# Assets Folder

This folder is intentionally included to demonstrate proper project structure and future scalability.

⚠️ No external assets (images, audio, video) are used in this project.

All card icons in the game are represented using Unicode emojis (🍎 🍊 🍇 🍉), which are natively supported in modern browsers.

If assets are added in the future (e.g., custom images or sounds), they will be stored in this folder and properly organized into subdirectories (e.g., `images/`, `audio/`).
